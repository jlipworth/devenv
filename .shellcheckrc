# .shellcheckrc - ShellCheck configuration for GNU_files
# https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/

# Disabled checks with rationale:
#
# SC2034: "X appears unused"
#   Variables ARE used - exported for scripts that source common_utils.sh
#
# SC2016: "Expressions don't expand in single quotes"
#   Intentional - we want literal strings like 'eval "$(opam env)"' in RC files
#
# SC2155: "Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values"
#   Style preference - our patterns are safe and readable as-is
#
# SC2012: "Use find instead of ls"
#   We're listing known paths (gcc versions) - ls is simpler and sufficient
#
# SC2162: "read without -r will mangle backslashes"
#   Interactive prompts don't expect backslash input
#
# SC2015: "A && B || C is not if-then-else"
#   Intentional pattern for "do X or log warning" - C is just logging
#
# SC2064: "Use single quotes in trap"
#   We intentionally capture variable at trap definition time, not execution
#
# SC2129: "Consider using { cmd1; cmd2; } >> file"
#   Style preference - sequential echoes are clearer for our use case
